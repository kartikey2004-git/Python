# # Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements

# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

# Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

# Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.


s = {1,5,32,7,7,8}
print(s)

# empty set creation
e = set() # don't use s = {} as it will create an empty dictionary
type(e)
# build unordered collection of unique elements
