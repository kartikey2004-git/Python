# Unlike strings, lists are mutable. This means we can change an item in a list by accessing it directly as part of the assignment statement. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an assignment, we can update one of the list items.

#lists elements are mutable by indexing
friends[0]="Grapes"
print(friends)
print(friends[1:4])

# lists are non primitive datatypes in python
